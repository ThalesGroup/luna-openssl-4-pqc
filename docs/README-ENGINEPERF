README-ENGINEPERF


  engineperf is C-language sample code showing how to
  access Luna HSM via OpenSSL engine interface
  and test performance thereof.

  It is located at gem-samples/engineperf

  engineperf depends on openssl and sautil.

  sautil and openssl have locations that depend on steps followed in "README-GEMBUILD".

  The Gem HSM middleware is configured according to file "README-GEM-CONFIG".



INSRUCTIONS


  STEP 1.  Build engineperf.

    # ./gembuild engineperf-build


  STEP 2. Open connection (and login).

    # sautil -v -s 1 -i 10:11 -o -q


  STEP 3. Setup and run the test.

    #cd gem-samples/engineperf

    # sh engineperf-test.sh --test-all --fips=1

    NOTE: It may be required to export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to point to the location of
          the openssl lib directory.  E.g.  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/ssl/lib

    NOTE: By default engineperf will attempt to run in FIPS mode if the openssl has FIPS support.
          If openssl hasn't been compiled with the FIPS module, this option isn't required.


  STEP 4. You can delete temporary keys and keyfiles.

    # sh engineperf-test.sh --delete-all



DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM


  The engineperf program runs various crypto operations on the HSM and measures the performance
  of the operations.

  It tests the performance of:
    random number generation
    RSA sign
    RSA verify
    RSA encrypt with a private key
    RSA decrypt with a public key
    RSA encrypt with a public key
    RSA decrypt with a private key
    DSA sign
    DSA verify
    ECDSA sign
    ECDSA verify

  Below is an example line of the output and the interpretation:
    RAND 512 bytes: 3418241 loops in 5026204 micro-seconds (680084.27992 Hz).

    This means that the random number generation operation was executed
    3418241 times in an elapsed time of 5.026204 seconds.  The effective
    number of cycles or operations per seconds (Hz) was 680084.27992.
