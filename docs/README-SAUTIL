README-SAUTIL

  sautil is a C-Language utility to be used in conjunction with the Gem Engine OpenSSL toolkit.

  The purpose of sautil is to allow a login state to be persisted for Application IDs and
  to be able to generate keys in the HSM with corresponding .pem files.  These .pem files
  are to be used by OpenSSL either by the command line tool or 3rd party applications that
  are dependent on OpenSSL.

  See README-RSA, README-DSA and README-ECDSA for examples of generating keys of various types.

  The source is located at gem-samples/sautil.

  For help, run command "sautil -h".



STRUCTURE OF PEM FILES

  .pem files generated by sautil do not contain the actual private key's secret information.  Instead
  the .pem file contains information that the Gem Engine uses to recognize that the key is in
  hardware and to identify the correct private key in the HSM.



APPLICATION IDS

  An application ID consists of a Major and Minor number that are used to identify an
  application context.  sautil can be used to open a application context for a given application ID
  and put this context into a logged in state.  This means that instances of an application
  that use the same application ID can access the HSM without providing the partition password.

  Throughout the different READMEs the value of 10:11 is seen.  This means a Major ID of 10
  and Minor ID of 11.  It is highly recommended to use different values for these.

  It should also be noted that using application IDs is considered to be insecure
  (see README-GEM-CONFIG for other login methods) in particular when the application context
  is left in a logged in state.  sautil should be be used to close the application context
  when no longer needed.
