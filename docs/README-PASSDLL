README-PASSDLL


  passdll is a feature whereby the gem engine retrieves a
  password from a shared-object (dynamic library).

  sample_passdll is a C-language sample showing how to 
  implement the passdll feature.



INSTRUCTIONS


  STEP 1. Customize the sample passdll program.

    gem-samples/passdll/sample_passdll.c contains three defines for MY_XOR_PIN, MY_XOR_PAD, MY_PIN_LEN.  These values
    should be modified to reflect the partition password and different random values should be chosen.
    This example prevents the partition password from being stored as plaintext in the shared object.

  NOTE:  This sample is not considered secure as it could easily be reverse engineered.  Customization
         should be done for a real-world implementation that provides adequate security.  The sample is
         only meant to provide an example of how to use the passdll api with the OpenSSL gem engine.


  STEP 2. Build the sample passdll (UNIX).

    # cd gem-samples/passdll

    # make clean

    # make

    # file sample_passdll.so


  STEP 3. Configure the /etc/Chrystoki.conf configuration file to enable passdll (UNIX).

    GemEngine = {
      ...
      EngineInit = 1:0:0:passdll=/path/to/my/sample_passdll.so;
      EnableLoginInit = 1;
    }
