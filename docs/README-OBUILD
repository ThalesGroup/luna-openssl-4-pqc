README-OBUILD

  "obuild8.makefile" is a makefile to build OpenSSL from source and to build the
  dynamic gem engine on Windows.


PREREQUISITES:

  Active State perl needs to be installed.
  Cygwin needs to be installed and its bin directory needs to be in PATH as obuild requires some UNIX commands on Windows.


INSTRUCTIONS:


  STEP 1. Download and extract an OpenSSL source tarball from https://www.openssl.org
          and place the .tar.gz file inside of the gemengine directory.


  STEP 2. Modify the VERSION and BASEVERSION variables in obuild8.makefile to match the
          OpenSSL version of the downloaded .tar.gz file.


  STEP 3. In a Visual Studio Command prompt (64 bit for 64 bit Windows binaries) compile OpenSSL
          with the gem engine.

    #  nmake -f obuild8.makefile cleanall

    #  nmake -f obuild8.makefile all-win32  CFG_SUFFIX=win32
OR
    #  nmake -f obuild8.makefile all-win64  CFG_SUFFIX=win64


  STEP 4. Tar balls with the OpenSSL binaries, dynamic gem engine and sautil are in the LUNALocal directory.
          As well the binaries will be located at c:\cygwin\usr\local\ssl.


  STEP 5. Use sautil to open the access to HSM and generate the keys

    #  sautil -v -s 1 -i 10:11 -o -q

    #  sautil -v -s 1 -i 10:11 -g 1024 -f tmpkey.pem


  STEP 6. Test the openssl command using the gem engine.

    #  openssl req  -engine gem  -new -nodes -key tmpkey.pem -out tmpkey.req -days 30 -verify

    NOTE:  It make be required to set a few environment variables first:

      #  set CONF_PATH="D:\Program Files\SafeNet\LunaClient\cryptoki.dll"

      #  set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\cygwin\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf


  STEP 7. Be sure to close the connection if using an AppID to open it.

     #  sautil.exe -v -s 1 -i 10:11 -c


  STEP 8. Modify the openssl.conf file to have the following section in place.

#add near the top of the file
openssl_conf = openssl_init
  
#add to the bottom of the file
[ openssl_init ]
engines = engine_section

[ engine_section ]
gem = gem_section

[ gem_section ]
dynamic_path = C:\\cygwin\\usr\\local\\ssl\\lib\\engines\\gem.dll
default_algorithms = ALL


  STEP 9. Modify the chrystoki.ini file to add the GemEngine section.

[GemEngine]
EngineInit = 1:10:11
EnableDsaGenKeyPair = 1
EnableRsaGenKeyPair = 1
DisablePublicCrypto = 1
EnableRsaSignVerify = 1
EnableLoadPubKey = 1
EnableLoadPrivKey = 1
DisableCheckFinalize = 1
DisableEcdsa = 1
DisableDsa = 0
DisableRand = 0
LibPath = D:\Program Files\SafeNet\LunaClient\cryptoki.dll
LibPath64 = D:\Program Files\SafeNet\LunaClient\cryptoki.dll

    NOTE:  See README-GEM-CONFIG for information on doing other configurations.
