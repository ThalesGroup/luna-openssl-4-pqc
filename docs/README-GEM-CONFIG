  and the filename is "%ChrystokiConfigurationPath%\crystoki.ini" (on Windows platform).



SUPPORTED ALGORITHMS
====================

  RSA, DSA, ECDSA, Random Number Generation.



HSM LOGIN OPTIONS
=================

  Application IDs (EXAMPLE 1),
  Console Interactive Login (EXAMPLE 4a),
  Plain Text Password in File (EXAMPLE 4b),
  Pass DLL (EXAMPLE 4c).



TABLE 1. FULL LIST OF CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
=============================================

  Below is the full list of variables.
  These variables configure the gem engine (not the cryptoki library).
  
                        DEFAULT
  VARIABLE NAME         VALUE    WHY CHANGE THIS VALUE?
  --------------------- -------- -------------------------------------------------------

MANDATORY:

  LibPath...............none.....must set path to cryptoki shared library (32-bit).
  LibPath64.............none.....must set path to cryptoki shared library (64-bit).
  EngineInit............none.....must set authentication settings.

OPTIONAL:

  DisableCheckFinalize..0........set to 1 if NOT using a forking application.  See NOTE below for more details.
  IntermediateProcesses.1........determines how many processes are between the main process and the child processes in a forking application.
  DisableDsa............1........set to 0 if DSA in hardware is required.
  DisableEcdsa..........1........set to 0 if ECDSA in hardware is required.
  DisableRand...........1........set to 0 if RNG in hardware is required.
  DisableRsa............0........set to 1 if RSA in hardware is not required.

  LogLevel..............0........set to 1 for logfiles in "/<LogRootDir>/e_lunahsm/lunaerr/".
  LogRootDir............/tmp.....set to other path if "/tmp" is not feasible.

  EnableDsaEx...........1........set to 0 if cache issue (DSA key handle cache).
  EnableEcdsaEx.........1........set to 0 if cache issue (ECDSA key handle cache).
  EnableRsaEx...........1........set to 0 if cache issue (RSA key handle cache).

  DisableMultiThread....0........set to 1 if thread-safety issue.
  DisableSessionCache...1........set to 0 to enable session cache.
  
  EnableLoadPrivKey.....0........set to 1 for apps that must call "ENGINE_load_private_key" (e.g., BIND).
  EnableLoadPubKey......0........set to 1 for apps that must call "ENGINE_load_public_key" (e.g., BIND).
  
  EnableRsaGenKeyPair...0........set to 1 for apps that must call "RSA_generate_key" (e.g., BIND).
  EnableDsaGenKeyPair...0........set to 1 for apps that must call "DSA_generate_key" (e.g., BIND).

  EnableLoginInit.......0........set to 1 for login via engine (i.e., instead of login via "sautil").

  Appliance.............Luna.....set to KeySecure to work in KeySecure mode.

NEW (for OpenSSL v1.0.0e and above)

  EnablePkeyMeths.......0........set to 1 for e.g., command "openssl dgst ...".
  EnablePkeyAsn1Meths...0........set to 1 for e.g., command "openssl dgst ...".
  EnableDigests.........0........set to 1 for e.g., command "openssl dgst ...".

NOTE:  DisableCheckFinalize can be used to alter how the engine behaves in terms of finalizing the cryptoki library.
       If an application has forking processes, then this causes the connection with the HSM to be shared between
       the parent and the child process which poses a problem.  If this option is set to 0 (default), when crypto calls
       are made in the parent process, the cryptoki library is finalized after each crypto call.  However, in the child
       process, the library is initialized and the connection to the HSM is maintained after crypto calls.  This way the
       parent and child will have different connections to the HSM.  If this option is set to 1, the engine will
       initialize the cryptoki library and maintain the connection to the HSM until the application terminates.  So if
       your application or 3rd party application is using OpenSSL and has forking processes, set this value to 0.
       Otherwise, setting the option to 1 will improve the performance.

NEW (for OpenSSL v1.0.1e and above)

  DisableRegisterAll....1........set to 0 for automatic loading of engine.

NEW (as of OpenSSL v1.1.0)

  EnableLimitedUser.....0........Set to 1 for login as Crypto-User (default is Crypto-Officer).
                                 Note there is a corresponding change in sautil; i.e., "sautil -u ...".

DEPRECATED (as of OpenSSL v1.1.0)

  DisablePublicCrypto...1........As a result, public key crypto in software always.
  EnableRsaSignVerify...0........As a result, RSA_sign redirects to RSA_private_encrypt always.



EXAMPLES
========

EXAMPLE 1. configure on UNIX for slot 1, App ID 10:11 (file "/etc/Chrystoki.conf").

  GemEngine = {
     LibPath = /usr/lib/libCryptoki2.so;
     LibPath64 = /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so;
     EngineInit = 1:10:11;
     DisableRand = 0;
     DisableDsa = 0;
     DisableEcdsa = 0;
     DisableCheckFinalize = 1;
  }

  NOTE: all variable names are case sensitive on UNIX; e.g., "Misc" and not "MISC".

  NOTE: all variable definitions end with a semi-colon (";") on UNIX.

  NOTE: EXAMPLE 4 gives other options for handling the HSM login.  It should be taken into
        consideration that App IDs should be used with caution.



EXAMPLE 2. configure on Windows (file "%ChrystokiConfigurationPath%\crystoki.ini").

  [GemEngine]
  LibPath = C:\Program Files\LunaSA\cryptoki.dll
  LibPath64 = C:\Program Files\LunaSA\cryptoki_64.dll
  EngineInit = 1:10:11
  DisableRand = 0
  DisableDsa = 0
  DisableEcdsa = 0
  DisableCheckFinalize = 1



EXAMPLE 3. configure for BIND v9.7 (DNSSEC) on UNIX (file "/etc/Chrystoki.conf").

  GemEngine = {
   EnableDsaGenKeyPair = 1;
   EnableRsaGenKeyPair = 1;
   EnableLoadPubKey = 1;
   EnableLoadPrivKey = 1;
   DisableCheckFinalize = 1;
   DisableEcdsa = 1;
   DisableDsa = 0;
   DisableRand = 0;
   EngineInit = 1:10:11;
   LibPath64 = /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so;
   LibPath = /usr/lib/libCryptoki2.so;
  }



EXAMPLE 4.

  The following examples configure the engine to perform a login every time
  your openssl-enabled application starts up.
  
  To avoid HSM lockout, it is recommended to specify the token label rather
  than the slotID.



EXAMPLE 4a. login via engine (interactive login via console).

  This option is useful as the login information is never stored on the file system.  However it
  may not be practical depending on the application.

  GemEngine = {
     ...
     EngineInit = "myTokenLabel":0:0:passdev=console;
     EnableLoginInit = 1;
  }
  
  NOTE: the token label must appear within double-quotation marks.
  NOTE: the appID 0:0 is a special case; it means do NOT call CA_SetApplicationID.



EXAMPLE 4b. login via engine (plaintext password in file).

  This option is simple to implement.  However this potentially exposes the partition password
  if an attacker gained access to the file system.

  GemEngine = {
     ...
     EngineInit = "myTokenLabel":0:0:passfile=/path/to/my/passfile;
     EnableLoginInit = 1;
  }



EXAMPLE 4c. login via engine (plaintext password gathered from dynamic link library).

  This method can provide more security than the passfile but requires custom development.
  See docs/README-PASSDLL for a sample of doing this.

  GemEngine = {
     ...
     EngineInit = "myTokenLabel":0:0:passdll=/path/to/my/passdll.so;
     EnableLoginInit = 1;
  }



EXAMPLE 5.  To configure the gem engine to work in KeySecure mode.  The following are typical values.

  GemEngine = {
     ...
     Appliance = KeySecure;
     EngineInit = 1:0:0:passfile=/path/to/passfile;
     EnableLoginInit = 1;
     EnableRsaGenKeyPair = 1;
     DisableDsa = 0;
     DisableRand = 0;
     EnableDsaGenKeyPair = 1;
     LibPath64 = /path/to/libPKCS11.so;
  }

  NOTE:  The contents of the passfile should be in the following format:
  <username>:<password>



EXAMPLE 6. configure for Apache on UNIX (file "/etc/Chrystoki.conf").

  GemEngine = {
   EnableDsaGenKeyPair = 0;
   EnableRsaGenKeyPair = 0;
   DisableCheckFinalize = 0;
   DisableEcdsa = 1;
   DisableDsa = 1;
   DisableRand = 1;
   EngineInit = 1:10:11;
   LibPath64 = /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so;
   LibPath = /usr/lib/libCryptoki2.so;
  }
