README-DSA


  The following steps show how to manipulate DSA keys
  using utilities 'sautil' and 'openssl'.
  
  sautil and openssl have locations that depend on steps followed in "README-GEMBUILD".

  The Gem HSM middleware is configured according to file "README-GEM-CONFIG".



INSTRUCTIONS


  NOTE:  Ensure that the line "DisableDsa = 0;" is in the GemEngine section of the Chrystoki.conf file.  The default value is 1.
         See README-GEM-CONFIG for details.


  STEP 1. Open connection (and login).

    # sautil -v -s 1 -i 10:11 -o -q

    NOTE: you should select a different value than "10:11"
      to customize your application environment.
      And you may select a different slot number than "1".


  STEP 2. Generate DSA parameters.

    # openssl dsaparam -out dsaparam.pem 1024


  STEP 3a. Generate keypair and keyfile (for use with OpenSSL).

    # sautil -v -s 1 -i 10:11 -d 1024:dsaparam.pem -f tmpkey.pem


or, STEP 3b. Generate keyfile (from existing key).


    # sautil -v -s 1 -i 10:11 -a 0:DSA -f tmpkey.pem


  STEP 4. Sign some data; e.g., sign a certificate request and verify the signature.

    # openssl req -engine gem -new -nodes -key tmpkey.pem -out tmpkey.req -days 30 -verify


  STEP 5. Close connection (and logout).

    # sautil -v -s 1 -i 10:11 -c



For more help, run command "sautil -h".

To import keys from other toolchains, consider using the
certificate management utility ("cmu") provided
with the main product release.
