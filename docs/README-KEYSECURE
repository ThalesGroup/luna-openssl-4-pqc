README-KEYSECURE


  This README will guide you how to configure the gem tool to attach to a KeySecure appliance.

  You will need to modify GemKS_setup.sh to point to your gem folder and GemKS properties file.

  These files are located in <path to gemengine>/keysecure.

  sample GemKS_setup.sh:
#!/bin/sh

# to run; source GemKS_setup.sh
#         or . GemKS_setup.sh

export SFNT_HSMAPI_BASE=<path to gemengine>/keysecure
export NAE_Properties_Conf_Filename=$SFNT_HSMAPI_BASE/GemKS.properties
export IngrianNAE_Properties_Conf_Slot_ID_Max=100
export IngrianNAE_Properties_Conf_SessionID_Max=100

  You will then need to modify your GemKS.properties file.  The modifications you make to the GemKS.properties file
  dictate how to connect to the KeySecure appliance.  The details on how to modify the properties file are given in
  007-012921-001_protectdb_pkcs11_oracle_tde_integrationguide_v6.1.1-RevB which can be retrieved from our customer portal.

  The typical changes are:

  ...
  NAE_IP=<your KeySecure appliance IP address>
  ...
  NAE_Port=9000 <-- this is the default insecure port
  ...
  Protocol=tcp <-- this is the typical insecure protocol, if you desire a secure connection then read the details in the guide.
  ...
  Log_File=/tmp/ProtectApp-Sample.log  <-- change this default if you wish, but at least note the location of the log file
  ...



  In order to configure the gemengine configuration must be added to /etc/Chrystoki.conf which needs to be create if not present.

  See EXAMPLE 5 inside of README-GEM-CONFIG for an example of how to configure the gemengine for KeySecure.
